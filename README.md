# format.py

The current working state of a serializer/deserializer/record library designed to make implementing the JAUS protocol easier.

It will eventually come with a proper JAUS server (many parts already exist as prototypes), but is currently incomplete.

To develop on Nix, type `nix-shell`.
For everywhere else, setup.py works as normal.
